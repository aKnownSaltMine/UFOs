# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide an easily accessible way to display the collected data of UFO sightings across the United States in a way that could be filtered across a multitude of criteria including date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
**Landing Page**

When entering the page, the page displays such as the picture above. Scrolling through, you can see the complete unfilterd data, such as what is displayed below:

On the left hand side of the HTML page, you will see the input boxes where you are able to input the filters needed or wanted. 

**Filter Boxes**

The script will detect a change in the box after typing and will then filter the data and display the row in which all filters apply.

## Summary

One drawback of this website is that because the filters are input boxes, one must be familiar with what is already in the table in order to return any results. Or, the user would have to find it by trial and error. Having drop down menus for selections that have set criteria such as State and City would make the page more approachable. 

Upon further development of this page, I would suggest cleaning the data provided first to make it more consistent and reader friendly. If this were accomplished further filters would be able to be added such as duration of the event.
