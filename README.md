# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to provide an easily accessible way to display the collected data of UFO sightings across the United States in a way that could be filtered across a multitude of criteria including date, city, state, country, and shape.

On the left hand side of the HTML page, you will see the input boxes where you are able to input the filters needed or wanted.

The script will detect a change in the box after typing and will then filter the data and display the row in which all filters apply.
